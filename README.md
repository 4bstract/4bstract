# Xbhl, known under the handle "xi"
### Cybersecurity and Computer Science student 
<p> I began <strong>self-taught</strong> and only began programming around mid 2023. </p>
<p> I take an interest in <strong>lower level</strong> programming, currently learning C++ whilst overall trying to improve my current coding output such as formatting, conventions and matching industry standards.  </p>
<p> Alongside programming, I plan on entering the field of Cybersecurity; including malware analysis, reverse engineering and such. </p>
<p> Currently I am finishing a college course regarding Information Technology; I plan on enrolling in a University that will expand my knowledge in Computer Science and Cybersecurity </p>
